# Although this theme suits the DWM theme. I would still recommend using "Rexo's Turquoise Theme" as it suits the overall Solarized Theme much better. You can find it in the 'Discover Themes' section.

# If you wish to retain my Light Blue/Cyan Colours. Just use my modified Turquoise Theme. The Irradiated Solarized is only darker in appearance than this theme.
