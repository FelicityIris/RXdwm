# You will need to install Powerlevel10k. These files are just for imitation. It is not recommended to copy these over.

# (It is recommended to store these as hidden files in /home/username by adding a . in front of the files.)

# To explain why I have added those 2 last lines in .zprofile. I have a NVIDIA GeForce GT 840M dedicated GPU and integrated Intel Graphics. Nvidia had for whatsoever reason decided to drop Va-api (GPU Acceleration) support for this GPU and some other older models. Due to which vdpau does not work. I had to switch to my Intel IG for video encoding and therefore the lines. Remove them if you have a newer GPU.
