# You will need to have python-pywal and zathura-pywal installed for this to work

- After saving the wallpaper, run this command `wal -i ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/SolShip1.png -a 0.5` to get correct colour scheme. This might temporarily change your st colours. Running a new instance will fix it, do not worry.

- Apply my zathurarc in $HOME/.config/zathura to get better colours.
