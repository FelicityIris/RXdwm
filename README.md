# Personal-DWM-and-desktop-Build
This Repository contains my DWM build along with related Desktop Files.

# Attention

Before Compiling, remember to check the config.def.h file for personalized issues. As this build was created solely to suit my own needs and in accordance to my system. Addresses and Program Commands may not resonate with your system.

# Desktop Previews

With Picom (Can cause issues like completely transparent windows sometimes with client opacity patch, you may remove the patch if you prefer using picom.conf, I generally do not use my system with Picom so I did not bother)
