This Repository contains the files and configurations related to RTRXdwm.

RTRXdwm - RT Redreoviƒç's X dynamic window manager is a custom build of dwm. It contains several patches one may require in a dynamic window manager. With marginal changes, one can easily use this portably.

Why was the Window Manager renamed? It is a whole package one would need to set up a functional X Display Server as well as a couple more features.

# Things that could have be done

- Fix layoutmenu
- - Currently the layout pops up but the indexing is broken and if one clicks on any layout, it simply doesn't run, though one can probably just use the hotkeys or layout cycle.

- Fix Menu Bug in Electron Apps.

- Fix Focus Ghosting in Applications after switching tags.

# Attention

Before Compiling, remember to check the \*.h files for personalized issues.

- Please note that only the patches inside the rtrxdwm-6.4/Patched/ directory are the ones that have been patched into the build. Any .diff or .patch in the rtrxdwm-6.4/Unpatched/ directory were removed at an earlier date for any reason.
